# RFP-Analysis
The following project was developed by Sam Kenney in 2023 as an exercise to learn and practice Python.
Although the situation described in this project draws broadly from professional experience of the author, no data represents real-life events.
The following competencies are demonstrated in this project:
- import and leverage libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, math
- complex user-input pathways to create user-defined input variables
- managing errors & exceptions
- data & variable manipulation: dictionaries, lists, arrays, tuples, for & while loops, list comprehension, nested list comprehension
- create and manipulate dataframes from external .csv files
- calculate percentile of user-input relative to various relevant distributions of similar procurement scenarios as detailed in .csv files
- create histograms to graphically represent percentile of user-input. Dynamic histogram parameters including: bins (size, number), colors, axes, labels

This program draws on randomized data gathered through a fictitious RFP process for procurement of new capital equipment. The fictional details are as follows:
Four vendors submitted proposals in response to this RFP with different possible solutions to the user's capital equipment needs.
Vendor proposals detail various pricing and discounting schemes across the two RFP product categories - here labeled as 'device' and 'instrument'
This program allows the user to forecast a 5-year expense associated with different procurement scenarios: 0-3 device procurements and 0-3 instrument procurements, for a total of 0-6 capital product procurements.
